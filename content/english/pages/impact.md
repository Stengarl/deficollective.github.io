The DeFi Collective was built to give genuine DeFi projects an edge. It supports them with offchain means, such as advising on tokenomics, protocol design, or communications, as well as onchain means‚Äîthe most notable and measurable of which is liquidity growth.

The Collective harnesses liquidity-driving tokens, including veVELO ([Velodrome](https://velodrome.finance/)), veAERO ([Aerodrome](https://aerodrome.finance/)), and veRAM ([Ramses](https://www.ramses.exchange/)). These allow the Collective to vote on a reoccuring basis on the respective DEX, whereby the DEX emissions incentives to liquidity providers of the liquidity pools that receive the most votes.  In line with the Collective's treasury policy, the Collective votes on liquidity pool containing token of genuine DeFi projects. Our voting helps to attract liquidity providers and hence grow the liquidity for the token - thus we refer to it as liquidity growth support. 

This page provides all the context for our community to **follow the liquidity growth support provided to genuine DeFi projects on the main chain the Collective is active on: Optimism, Base, and Arbitrum**.

It will prove useful to any community members looking to better understand how the Collective helps genuine DeFi projects, and to those who seek to join in the support as well by providing liquidity on voted pools.

## Optimism (Velodrome)

Optimism is the chain where the Collective has the most impact, thanks to a large veVELO position (~0.63% of the gauge):
