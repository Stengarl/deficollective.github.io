The DeFi Collective is designed to maximize the positive impact of maximally decentralized protocols. There are currently four main methods harnessed to achieve the core objective of maximizing the number and value secured by stage 2 DeFi protocols:

1. **DeFiScan**: DeFiScan analyzes protocols' decentralization status, helping to raise awareness for genuine DeFi.
2. **PermaLP**: The Collective assets are mobilized to ensure a constant product liquidity baseline on pairs involving stage 1 & 2 tokens.
3. **Liquidity Support**: Incentives are directed to pairs involving stage 1 & 2 tokens, helping to attract and retain liquidity.
4. **Community Relays**: Velodrome & Aerodrome voting strategies, managed by the Collective, to further support liquidity on tokens of stage 1 & 2 protocols

## DeFiScan

[DeFiScan](https://defiscan.info) is a framework to review the decentralization stage of DeFi protocols. The results of DeFiScan's reviews are also used internally within the Collective to determine where to provide the most support and deploy assets.

## PermaLP

Maximally decentralized projects often need help with liquidity management. In addition to its existing activities, the Collective sometimes provides additional support to stage 1 and 2 protocols by matching donations received with its own assets to permanently supply liquidity. The Collective commits to keep supplying the assets in liquidity pools in perpetuity, although freedom of allocation is preserved for strategic reasons: while the funds remain in a pool, their DEX or pairing might evolve. Rewards earned with these permaLP positions are used to serve the core objective of the Collective further.

### PermaLP Arrangements Overview

The table below provides an overview of the ongoing and previous permaLP sources:

| Project      | Status               | Pace           |
| ------------ | -------------------- | -------------- |
| PoolTogether | Delivered (one time) |                |
| PossumLabs   | Ongoing (continuous) | 0.5  ETH/month |
| BOLD         | Ready                | $20 000/month  |

A [Dune Dashboard](https://dune.com/spicypiz/defi-collective-perma-lp) is available to faciliaate the tracking of the Collective's permaLP positions.

## Liquidity Support

The DeFi Collective was built to give genuine DeFi projects an edge. It supports them with offchain means, such as advising on tokenomics, protocol design, or communications, as well as onchain means‚Äîthe most notable and measurable of which is liquidity growth.

The Collective harnesses liquidity-driving tokens, including veVELO ([Velodrome](https://velodrome.finance/)), veAERO ([Aerodrome](https://aerodrome.finance/)), and veRAM ([Ramses](https://www.ramses.exchange/)). These allow the Collective to vote regularly on the respective DEX, whereby the DEX emissions incentives to liquidity providers of the liquidity pools that receive the most votes.  In line with the Collective's treasury policy, the Collective votes on a liquidity pool containing tokens of genuine DeFi projects. Our voting helps to attract liquidity providers and hence grow the liquidity for the token - thus we refer to it as liquidity growth support. 

This page provides all the context for our community to **follow the liquidity growth support provided to genuine DeFi projects on the main chain the Collective is active on: Optimism, Base, and Arbitrum**.

It will prove useful to any community members looking to better understand how the Collective helps genuine DeFi projects and to those who seek to join in the support by providing liquidity on voted pools.

## Optimism (Velodrome)

Optimism is the chain where the Collective has the most impact, thanks to a large veVELO position (~0.63% of the gauge):

### veVELO Active Votes

These votes are active for the current voting period, which lasts a week (epoch flips at 2AM GMT+2). Pools that are voted on by the Collective receives increased VELO emissions by the Velodrome DEX, helping them to attract more third-party liquidity providers.

## Base (Aerodrome)

Base is the second top chain for the Collective, thanks to a growing veAERO position.

### veAERO Active Votes

These votes are active for the current voting period, which lasts a week (epoch flips at 2AM GMT+2). The Collective's veAERO vote directs AERO emissions from the Aerodrome DEX to targeted pools, helping them to attract more third-party liquidity providers.

## Arbitrum (Ramses)

Arbitrum is the third top chain for the Collective, and home to the only L2-native genuine DeFi project we support so far: Possum.

## Community Relays

The Collective operates a relay on both Velodrome and Aerodrome. Relays are a voting strategy that any holder of veAERO/veVELO can opt in to while remaining in complete control of its assets and the rewards it earns. The Collective relays vote exclusively on pools involving tokens from stage 1 & 2 protocols. Community members who hold veAERO/veVELO and would like to support the most decentralized protocols can delegate here:
