The DeFi Collective was built to give genuine DeFi projects an edge. It supports them with offchain means, such as advising on liquidity structures, tokenomics, protocol design, or communications, as well as onchain means‚Äîthe most notable and measurable of which is liquidity.

The Collective harnesses liquidity-driving positions, allowing it to direct incentives to providers of selected liquidity pools. These include veVELO ([Velodrome](https://velodrome.finance/)), veAERO ([Aerodrome](https://aerodrome.finance/)), and veRAM ([Ramses](https://www.ramses.exchange/)).

This page provides all the context for our community to follow the support provided to genuine DeFi projects on the main chain the Collective is active on: Optimism, Base, and Arbitrum.

It will prove useful to any community members looking to better understand how the Collective helps genuine DeFi projects, and to those who seek to join in the support as well by providing liquidity on supported pools.
