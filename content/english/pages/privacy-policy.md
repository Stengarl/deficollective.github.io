## About us

This privacy policy ("**Privacy Policy**") explains how we process and protect your personal data when you use this Website provided via https://deficollective.org ("**Website**").

The Collective will not monetize your personal data and is committed to absolutely minimizing its impact on your privacy.

The Website is operated by DeFi Collective, Dammstrasse 16, 6300 Zug (the "**Collective**", "**we**", "**our**", or "**us"**). The Collective is the controller for the data processing described below.

Unless otherwise defined in this Privacy Policy or our Terms, the definitions used in this Privacy Policy have the same meaning as in the Swiss Federal Act on Data Protection or the EU General Data Protection Regulation.

## Personal data we collect

We may collect or receive personal information for a number of purposes connected with our operations when you use our Website or contact us. This may include user requests (e.g. details about your inquiries) and certain limited Website visitor details (e.g. IP address, logfiles).

### How we collect your personal data

We may collect information about our users when they use our Website, including taking certain actions within it. This includes when users correspond with us by electronic means and when users access, use, or otherwise interact with our Website.

### Legal Basis and purpose

Our legal basis for collecting and using the personal data described in this Privacy Policy depends on the personal data we collect and the specific purposes for which we collect it.

1. **Contract**: To perform our contractual obligations or take steps linked to a contract (e.g., our Terms) with you. In particular:
* To provide our Website and our content.
* To coordinate your support of the Collective.
* To recruit you.
2. **Consent**: We may rely on your freely given consent at the time you provided your personal data. In particular:
* To answer your requests, your reach-outs or similar contact you may establish with us.
* To provide you with news, newsletters, and general information about our activities and our mission (note that we do not currently have a newsletter, and will never send you any newsletter unless you specifically request it from us).
3. **Legitimate interests**: We may rely on legitimate interests based on our assessment that the processing is fair and reasonable and does not override your interests or fundamental rights and freedoms. In particular:
* To maintain and improve our Website.
* To extend our activities in support of our mission and vision.
4. **Necessity for compliance with legal obligations**: To meet regulatory and public interest obligations. In particular:
* To comply with applicable regulations and legislation.
* For the legal enforcement of claims and rights.

### Data retention

We retain personal data for so long as it is needed for the purposes for which it was collected or in line with legal and regulatory requirements or contractual arrangements.

### Service Providers

The Collective may engage third party companies ("**Service Providers**") to facilitate the operation of our Website, assist in analyzing the usage of the Website, or perform Website-related services, such as the provision of IT infrastructure services. These third parties have access to the user’s personal data only to the extent necessary to perform these tasks on behalf of the Collective.

We particularly use the Services of Matomo, an [open source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-source_software) web analytics platform (a privacy-friendly alternative to Google Analytics). A web analytics platform is used by a website owner in order to measure, collect, analyze and report visitors data for purposes of understanding and optimizing their website. Matomo is used to analyze the behavior of the website visitors to identify potential pitfalls; not found pages, search engine indexing issues, which contents are the most appreciated… Once the data is processed (number of visitors reaching a not found page, viewing only one page…), Matomo is generating reports for website owners to take action, for example changing the layout of the pages, publishing some fresh content… etc. We do not use cookies with Matomo. For more information on how Matomo works, please refer to their [Website ](https://matomo.org)and [Privacy Policy](https://matomo.org/privacy-policy/#:~:text=We%20believe%20in%20openness%2C%20privacy,and%20that%20will%20never%20change.). 

If a third country transfer takes place and there is no adequacy decision or appropriate safeguards, it is possible and there is a risk that authorities in the third country (e.g. intelligence services) can gain access to the transferred data and that the enforceability of your data subject's rights cannot be guaranteed**.**

### Data disclosure

We may disclose your personal data in the good faith belief that such action is necessary:



* To comply with a legal obligation (i.e., if required by law or in response to valid requests by public authorities, such as a court or government agency);
* To protect the security of the Website and defend our rights or property;
* To prevent or investigate possible wrongdoing in connection with us;
* To defend ourselves against legal liability.

**Data security**

We take reasonable technical and organizational security measures that we deem appropriate to protect your stored data against manipulation, loss, or unauthorized third-party access. We continually aim to adapt our security measures to technological developments.

We also take internal data privacy very seriously. Our team and the Service Providers that we retain are required to maintain secrecy and comply with applicable data protection legislation. In addition, they are granted access to personal data only insofar as this is necessary for them to carry out their respective tasks or mandate.

The security of your personal data is important to us but remember that no method of transmission over the Internet or electronic storage is 100% secure. While we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your personal data, we cannot guarantee its absolute security. We recommend using antivirus software, a firewall, and other similar software to safeguard your system.

## Your rights

You have the below data protection rights. To exercise these rights, you may contact the above address or send an e-mail to: hello@deficollective.org. Please note that we may ask you to verify your identity before responding to such requests.



* Right of access: You have a right to request a copy of your personal data, which we will provide to you in an electronic form.
* Right to amendment: You have the right to ask us to correct our records if you believe they contain incorrect or incomplete information about you.
* Right to withdraw consent: If you have provided your consent to the processing of your personal data, you have the right to withdraw your consent with effect for the future. Once we have received notification that you have withdrawn your consent, we will no longer process your information for the purpose(s) to which you initially consented unless there is another legal basis for processing.
* Right to erasure: You have the right to request that we delete your personal data when it is no longer necessary for the purposes for which it was collected or when it was unlawfully processed.
* Right to restriction of processing: You have the right to request the restriction of our processing of your personal data where you believe it to be inaccurate, our processing is unlawful, or where we no longer need to process it for the initial purpose, but where we are not able to delete it due to a legal obligation or because you do not want us to delete it.
* Right to portability: You have the right to request that we transmit your personal data to another data controller in a standard format such as Excel, where this is data which you have provided to us and where we are processing it on the legal basis of your consent or to perform our contractual obligations.
* Right to object to processing: Where the legal basis for our processing of your personal data is our legitimate interest, you have the right to object to such processing on grounds relating to your particular situation. We will abide by your request unless we have a compelling legal basis for the processing which overrides your interests or if we need to continue to process the personal data for the exercise or defence of a legal claim.
* Right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority: You have the right of appeal to a data protection supervisory authority if you believe that the processing of your personal data violates data protection law. The competent data protection authority in Switzerland is the Federal Data Protection and Information Commissioner ([www.edoeb.admin.ch/edoeb/en/home.html](http://www.edoeb.admin.ch/edoeb/en/home.html)). For the EU, you can exercise this right, for example, before a supervisory authority in the Member State of your residence, your place of work or the place of the alleged infringement.

## Links to third party apps or sites

Our website may contain links to websites or apps that are not operated by us. When you click on a third party link, you will be directed to that third party's website or app. We have no control over, and assume no responsibility for, the content, privacy policies, or practices of any third party websites or services.

We maintain online presences on social networks to, among other things, communicate with users and to provide information about our activities and our vision and mission. If you have an account on the same network, it is possible that your information and media made available there may be seen by us, for example, when we access your profile. In addition, the social network may allow us to contact you. The content communication via the social network and the processing of the content data is thereby subject to the responsibility of the social network. As soon as we transfer personal data into our own system, we are responsible for this independently. This is then done in order to carry out pre-contractual measures and to fulfill a contract. For the legal basis of the data processing carried out by the social networks under their own responsibility, please refer to their data protection declarations. Below is a list of social networks on which we operate an online presence:



* Discord: [Privacy Policy](https://discord.com/privacy)
* X (Twitter):[ Privacy Policy](https://twitter.com/en/privacy)
* YouTube:[ Privacy Policy](https://policies.google.com/privacy?)
* LinkedIn:[ Privacy Policy](https://www.linkedin.com/legal/privacy-policy?)

## Changes to this Privacy Policy

We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. We, therefore, encourage you to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes.

Changes to this Privacy Policy are effective when they are posted on this page.
