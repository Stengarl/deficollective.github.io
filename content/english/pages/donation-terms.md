## Donation Terms

Any donations made to the account [grantsfortheants.eth](https://etherscan.io/address/0xDc6f869d2D34E4aee3E89A51f2Af6D54F0F7f690) (0xDc6f869d2D34E4aee3E89A51f2Af6D54F0F7f690), on any of the supported chains: Ethereum Mainnet, Arbitrum, Base, Optimism, Polygon-POS and Polygon-zkEVM, will be attributed to the Swiss association DeFi Collective, Dammstrasse 16, 6300 Zug, Switzerland ("Collective"). Donations are not deductible for tax income purposes under Swiss law, and you are solely responsible for understanding and complying with any tax or similar obligations in connection with any donation. You will receive no direct support or reciprocation (e.g., goods or services) in return for your donation. The Collective may use donations in line with its purpose as laid out in the current version of the Collectiveâ€™s articles of association and further funding and governance policies (as may be introduced and amended from time to time, and as available on the DeFi Collective's website). You acknowledge and agree that within these limitations, the Collective has sole discretion on how to allocate and use donations and any donations by you are made free of any conditions, provisions, or similar, and, for the avoidance of doubt, do not need to be returned to you.

The Collective and you may enter into a separate agreement governing your donation and/or other support, in which case (unless specifically agreed otherwise) such separate agreement prevails.
