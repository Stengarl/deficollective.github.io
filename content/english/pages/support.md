Our mission is to advance the decentralized finance movement through direct support of DeFi protocols and working with the broader financial industry, policymakers and the general public to create an environment in which this technology can deliver on its promise of making finance a secure, transparent and efficient public infrastructure.

But, as a non-profit organization **we need your help**.

There are multiple ways how you can support us:

- Donations
- Contributions

Please contact us under hello@deficollective.org or reach out on our discord if you want more information.
