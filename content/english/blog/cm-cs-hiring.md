If you are unfamiliar with the DeFi Collective, we invite you to browse this website for more context; a short introduction follows. The Collective is a Swiss nonprofit association **harnessing DeFi to nudge it toward maximal resilience and responsibility**. It **self-appoints** to support the most resilient DeFi projects, no question asked, thanks to its own assets, including sizable liquidity-driving token balances (veVELO, veAERO, veRAM, etc.). The Collective has been **self-sufficient since its inception**, generating ~$30k of monthly earnings, compounded into its treasury to further its impact — check the monthly treasury report for more information. 

The two profiles will work closely together, as they essentially work towards a common goal — raising the public profile of the Collective and growing its community, but with different means. The Community Manager is focused on the day-to-day tactics, while the Content Strategist will oversee the longer-term strategy and its implementation.
