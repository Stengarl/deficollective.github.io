Involving the community is necessary and all spontaneous contributions are welcome. Whether you’re a developer, researcher, marketer, policy expert, or simply someone passionate about our mission, your insights and skills can make a significant difference.

Some members showed expertise, availability, and a degree of autonomy in the tasks performed, so they became contributors over time.

Meanwhile, we also need to reward members who help the collective outside of contributors. That’s why we introduced the “Ant of the Month”, a special status with a financial incentive.

## How to besome Ant of the Month"?

The best way to find out how to get this title is to see the previous ants of the month:

**Stengarl** is the first Ant of the Month. His most meaningful contribution is the [Recap aggregator](https://deficollective.notion.site/Recap-Aggregator-461447ece7ff4de784a225aff61b2849?pvs=4), where he shares recaps from live recordings about DeFi in general, which can be events or podcasts. 

For an hour of live coverage, the recap contains the essential information in less than 10 minutes of reading time, allowing us to get maximum news in a minimum amount of time.

After being Ant of the month for some months, Stengarl is now an official contributor to the Collective, in parallel to working for the professional training organization Alyra.

**Cleminso** has been awarded Ant of the Month thanks to [“Anthill Highlights”](https://defic.substack.com/p/defi-collective-05-anthill-highlight), a monthly newsletter that describes the news within the collective and the projects supported by the collective.

Searching for project information on different social networks quickly becomes complex. Anhill highlights regroup all the news on a single page, so it greatly helps to catch up on news about genuine DeFi as a whole.

Outside of his contribution to the Collective, Cleminso also works as a product manager for Alcyone Labs, a studio working on a frontend aggregator for multiple on-chain protocols and products, starting with the oracleless lending protocol Ajna.

**ABertoG** became Ant of the month for alerting the team about the availability of the "DeFi Collective" [ENS domain](https://ens.domains/) (an unknown address was holding it, but the ENS expired so it was available). The Collective was able to snap the deficollective.eth ENS, now resolving to the main treasury.

Besides that, AbertoG is a long-time DeFi professional. In fact, for several years, she worked as a risk manager for the lending protocol Aave, Head of Strategy for the liquidity layer Mangrove, and is now working for Allez Labs, a risk analysis team.

The current Ant of the month is **Brian McMichael**, for bringing the first-ever community review, very soon after the launch of DeFiScan. DeFiScan is a dashboard created by the Collective which aims to monitor the decentralization of DeFi protocols so users can tell how much “De” is in their “Fi”.

Brian McMichael published the first-ever community review that concerned Ajna, an oracleless lending protocol. Thanks to his review, it is stated that Ajna is a Stage 1 protocol. Brian currently works for Ajna and is a former developer for the stablecoin issuer MakerDAO.

**Four ants of the month so far, yet four different ways to get the title.** There are also many other ways to help the Collective:
* Development
* Onchain analytics
* Community reviews for DeFiScan
* Governance activities
* Visuals...
  
In other words, all relevant contributions for the Collective are taken into consideration to get the title of Ant of the Month, and the rewards coming with it!

## A 10,000 USDC delegation from PoolTogether

PoolTogether DAO allocated to the Collective the option to delegate 10,000 USDC. This delegation is possible since the [PTBR-16](https://gov.pooltogether.com/t/rfc-v2-ptbr-16-the-defi-collective/3231) proposal validation in which the Collective formalized its commitment to the protocol.

This delegated amount stays in a wallet controlled by PoolTogether, but the benefactor will earn all the winning odds. It’s like the delegation owner was playing with 10,000 USDC, and this delegation is given every month to the Collective's most committed community members!

In addition to having all the winning odds from the delegation, you can also get other rewards. For example, a delegation on the Optimism network allows to claim OP tokens which are added to the yield.

Cleminso gave us a good example of what we receive as Ant of the Month: for one month holding the Pooltogether delegation, we can have a 3-digit revenue with both winning odds and OP rewards.

Most of the revenue is distributed in the form of OP tokens, but since we are in a lottery, it's also possible to have a stroke of luck and win a larger amount in one go.

Thanks to the PoolTogether delegation, we can reward genuine DeFi dedicated members with genuine DeFi. Somehow, we use DeFi for better DeFi and that’s all the Collective is about!
