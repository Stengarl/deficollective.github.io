## FAQ

**Why mint it?**

To support the DeFi Collective and help us celebrate our first anniversary. Many reasons can lead you to support us!



* You want to support maximally decentralized DeFi, and help innovative and decentralized, and value-aligned projects thrive, 
* You are following us and find value in doing so, maybe you liked some of the content we shared or just like the vibes in our Discord,
* You LPed on some pools we support, and independently earned some revenue while supporting genuine DeFi projects,
* You just like the art (Arke is our favorite NFT artist by a long shot, we hope you like the art as much as we do).

**What are the minting conditions?**

Each NFT can be minted for 0.01 ETH (~ $24 at the time of writing) on Optimism. You can mint multiple NFTs if you wish to donate more. All donations are sent to grantsfortheants.eth. The NFT collection has no creator fee. 

Up to 1000 NFTs can be minted during the minting period: from October 16th to November 6th, 2024. After November 6th, minting will be closed. No more NFTs will be issued after this date. 

If you missed the deadline or did not make it in the first 1000 minters, you can still donate to us at grantsfortheants.eth, and drop us a message on our discord. Please check out our support page [here](https://deficollective.org/support/).

If you can’t give that amount and still want to support the DeFi Collective, there are plenty of ways: join our discord and start contributing to the discussion today!

**What will be the NFT’s utility?**

None! There is no utility and you will not receive any financial or non-financial benefits from us. This NFT only acts like a digital donation receipt. You donate to us with no strings attached. You get the NFT as bragging rights for supporting maximally decentralized DeFi, but you won’t be able to do anything with it other than showcasing it in your wallet. 

**How will the proceeds be used?**

All donations will be sent to our treasury to support maximally decentralized DeFi projects in line with our purpose. Our operations are fully on-chain and our financials are transparent and auditable. Projects we support include Liquity, DYAD, Aerodrome, Velodrome, Maverick, PoolTogether, Diva, Possum Labs, and HAI.
